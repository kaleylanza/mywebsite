## Goal

To predict the 2024 Ladder Score for each country and to understand which factors in 2023 influence the happiness score the following year.

## Data Cleaning 

- Merged datasets containing the 2023 and 2024 World       Happiness Reports side by side on country name 
- Dropped rows with missing values 
- Excluded columns that could leak outcome information
    Upper whisker 
    Lower whisker 
    Dystopia + residual value (leftover part of the          happiness score that isn't explained by other            factors)
- Selected 2023 features as predictors and 2024 ladder     score as the target 
- Originally, I wanted to predict the change in ladder     score from 2023 to 2024
